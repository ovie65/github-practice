        We start this section with a chapter that explains how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages. 
        We then go on to look at the wide variety of CSS properties you can use in your CSS rules. 
        These properties generally fall into one of two categories:
        Presentation: How to control things like the color of text, the fonts you want to use and the size of those fonts,
         how to add background colors to pages (or parts of a page), and how to add background images.

    <h3>When you are looking at a website, 
        it is most likely that your browser will be receiving HTML and CSS from the web server that hosts the site.
         The web browser interprets the HTML and CSS code to create the page that you see. 
        Most web pages also include extra content such as images, 
        audio, video, or animations and this book will teach you how to prepare 
        them for use on the web and then how to insert them into your web pages.
