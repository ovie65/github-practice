        <h4>htML5 & css3
        Since the web was first created there have been several versions of HTML and CSS 
        â€” each intended to be an improvement on the previous version. 
        At the time of writing this book,
         HTML5 & CSS3 were still being developed.
          Although they had not been finalized,
           many browsers were already supporting some features of these languages and a lot of people were using the latest code on their websites.
            I have therefore chosen to teach you these latest versions. 
        Because HTML5 and CSS3 build on previous versions of these languages
        , learning these means you will also be able to understand the earlier versions of them. I have added clear notes when the code is new and also
         when it might not work in older browsers
